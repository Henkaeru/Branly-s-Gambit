the idea is having dev, opti and syst be kinda balanced types. data is ultra defensive. proj is overpowered in attack and greatd in defense. (like pokemon dragon type) team is kinda defensive, and the one good type at attacking proj. (like pokemon fairy type)

| **SYST** | ½          | Systems are resistant to system-level attacks (redundancy, stability). |
| **DATA** | 1          | Data flows through systems but is not inherently vulnerable.           |

| **OPTI** | ½          | Data structures resist excessive optimization (risk of corruption). |
| **SYST** | ½          | Systems protect data — low damage in either direction.              |
| **DATA** | ½          | Data conflicts stabilize or normalize quickly.                      |
| **PROJ** | 1          | Projects use data but don’t exploit it directly.                    |
