# move/strategies idea

List of moves/strategies that don't really make a fighter category by themselves

* Some buff that buff you and your opponent, but your's better (same for debuff)
* Some shity move that is here to charge your ult
* Some fighter have shitty moves, but they load the ult fast, and their ult is crazy
* some kind of self-harming build "i die but you die first"
* some low-accuracy high value move, if you fail it's bad, if you don't it's real good
* some moves that can copy an opponent's move
* some one shot ultimate, that is real hard to build-up
* some move that gives you a kind of undying status, next time you die you don't, and it does stuff, idk what
* some fighter have a basic move, and all the other requires charge to use
* some kind of fighter that change archetype entirely mid-battle, like by clicking his ultimate for example
* some kind of fighter that uses his armor as damage
* some kind of fighter that uses his charge amount as damage (so he doesn't wanna use is ult, but his ult like heal or smth)
